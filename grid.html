      <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I have never written a line of code 
        I needed some structures from professionals who can help me learn 
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the programme. 
        The entire curriculum and the staff did not disappoint. They are very 
        hand-on and I never need a had to wait long for assistance. The agile 
        team project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the 
        next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. Infact I have 
        often refered to it during interview as an example of my development experience. It certainly land me a job as full-stack developer after receiving multiple offer 100% reccomended."</p>
